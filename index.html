      <p id="1stp">'Jack of all trades, master of none'. I am completely indifferent to this sententia! I don't stop at 1 or 2, but 8 hobbies! To name some, swimming, basketball, writing poetry, baking and cookery, reading, singing, art, athletics and cycling are all on my acquaintance list. All these have helped me in innumerable ways, for example, playing sports has given me leadership qualities and diligence, while art and writing, my creativity. Baking and cooking makes me a precise and conscientious girl, while reading my favourite, genre of books, historical fiction, has matured and deepened my understanding. Singing has helped increased what was previously an extremely tiny amount of confidence. These hobbies are irreplaceable in my life, and have been the only friends I have known during this lockdown at home.</p>
